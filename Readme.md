# Privately Connecting Mobility to Infectious Diseases via Applied Cryptography

This repository contains the source code of the paper `Privately Connecting Mobility to Infectious Diseases via Applied Cryptography`. [1, 2]

## Source code

The code is based on Microsoft [SEAL](https://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL) (version 3.6.6) and is compatible with Windows and Linux.
This repository contains a demo application (using random data) to perform the matrix multiplication on encrypted data, including the proving mask, noise flooding, and differential privacy. Use `params.h` for a parametrization of the code.

## Compilation

Execute the `compile.sh` script (which contains the following commands) to compile the source code:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd SEAL
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 6
cd ../..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 6
```

The binaries can then be found in the `bin` folder:

| Executable | Parameter | Description                                                                      |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| main       |           | Executes the client and the server                                               |
| client     | enc       | Creates keys, encrypts an input string, and stores everything on the file system |
| server     |           | Takes ciphertexts and keys from the file system and executes the protocol        |
| client     | dec       | Takes ciphertexts from the file system and decrypts the result of the protocol   |

## Docker

One can use docker to compile and run the code. The following command creates a docker container with the compiled executables being present in the `app` folder:

```bash
docker build -t heatmap .
```

Use the following command to get a bash shell inside the `app` folder of the container:

```bash
docker run -it heatmap
```
