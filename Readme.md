# Privately Connecting Mobility to Infectious Diseases via Applied Cryptography

This repository contains the source code of the paper `Privately Connecting Mobility to Infectious Diseases via Applied Cryptography`.

## Source code

The code is based on Microsoft [SEAL](https://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL) (version 3.6.6) and is compatible with Windows and Linux.
This repository contains a demo application to perform the matrix multiplication on encrypted data, including the proving mask, noise flooding, and differential privacy. Use `params.h` for a parametrization of the code.

## Compilation

Execute the following commands to compile the source code:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd SEAL
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ../..
